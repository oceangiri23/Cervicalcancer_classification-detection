# **EfficientNet-B5 Fine-Tuned Model for Cervical Cancer Classification**

This project features a **fine-tuned EfficientNet-B5 model** developed for the **classification of cervical cancer** into five distinct categories. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed/data), specifically curated to enhance accuracy in early cancer detection.

## **Model Performance**
- **Accuracy**: `96.31%`
- **Precision**: `96.34%`
- **Recall**: `96.31%`
- **F1-Score**: `96.31%`

## **Cancer Categories**
The model is capable of classifying cervical cancer into the following categories:
1. **Dyskeratotic**
2. **Koilocytotic**
3. **Metaplastic**
4. **Parabasal**
5. **Superficial-Intermediate**

## **Dataset**
You can access the dataset used for training from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed/data).
